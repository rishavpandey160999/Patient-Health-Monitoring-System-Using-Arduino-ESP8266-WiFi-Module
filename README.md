Project Description:   Sometimes it happens when patients struggles to find hospital beds but due to high number of covid patients they are forced to stay at home and aren't monitored by any doctor. This Health Monitoring System designed with the help of Arduino UNO board and ESP8266 wifi microchip helps the doctor to monitor the patient remotely (connected via an IoT based platform ThingSpeak). ESP8266 wi-fi microchip is used to provide internet connectivity to our project (or we can connect our project to any wifi using same). The system consists of a pulse sensor and and an LM35 temperature sensor which measures the patient's heart beats per minute and body temperature respectively. The Arduino reads the sensor data, converts them into string, passes them to the IoT platform (ThingSpeak) and also displays the BPM and body temperature on LCD display.

In this way a doctor can remotely monitor the patients and take appropriate actions when required.
